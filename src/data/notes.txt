you make assumptions based off the things you feel, read, etc.
if/when my assumptions are incorrect, I use a little more care
in making them. that's called wisdom. if i burn my finger on a 
candle, i don't go right back to sticking my finger on the
candle expecting a different result. 

I've been very clear. I'm not pushing you away. What time do I
spend to myself? Really? I work. I come home. I don't have any
friends. I don't spend time with anyone else. I don't go anywhere
with anyone else. Every vacation that I've had for as long as I
can remember has been with you. And yet. All you believe is
I'd like to push away from you. Why?
